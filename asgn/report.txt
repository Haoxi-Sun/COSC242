My contributions to the assignment
Effort:  Writing the majority of the source code, include asgn.c, htable.c, htable.h, mylib.c, and mylib.h. Also debug the programs.
Usefulness:  These five programs are the most important part in the assignment.

The contributions of __Grace_Zhan___
Effort: Checking through all the programs that Elsie and Xiaoqian has written, modify the code to make it cleaner and wrote 
comments for each one. 
Usefulness: Comments can remind and reflect on what programmer have done and the purpose of each function, also save 
time for others to read through the codes and try to find what all is happening in the code. Clean code makes the codes readble. 

The contributions of __Xiaoqian_Yan__
Effort:  Writing the comment of asgn.c and rewrite the function of prime part.
Usefulness:  Comments makes the source code easier for others to understand. The function makes the right size of a hash table.

My thoughts on the positives and negatives of working in a group.

My group members are very excellent, they wrote all the comments and fixed an error that I did not realize. Besides, they are responsibility and  carefulness 
that checking my code line by line and trying to make the style and code better, which I need  to learn from them, because 
I offen overlook some details.

However, my timeline is a little bit rush, which makes me have to finish this assignment as soon as possible, but my group members
wanted to do other assignment first. Thus I did all the coding. But I'm happy with this because this assignment helps me have a 
deeper understanding on C language, and I believe it will bring more benefit and opportunity for my future career.
